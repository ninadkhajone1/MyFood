# üçΩÔ∏è MyFood - Online Food Ordering App

link to see my app : https://ninadkhajone1.github.io/MyFood/  *IMP* [ Remember I have saved Data in Database and git can't access database so data won't be visible , also you can't signup and login until i host it ]

A full-stack food ordering web app built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.

##  Features
- User Signup & Login (JWT Auth)
- Browse & order food
- Auto-fetch current location
- Cart management
- View past orders
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 Dark

## How It Works

1. **User signs up or logs in**  
   - Credentials are securely stored in MongoDB with hashed passwords.  
   - JWT is issued on login for authentication.

2. **Homepage loads available food items**  
   - Data comes from MongoDB Atlas via Express API.

3. **User adds food to cart and places order**  
   - Cart data is stored in React Context.  
   - On placing order, data is sent to backend and saved in MongoDB.

4. **Order history (My Orders)**  
   - Logged-in users can view their past orders.

5. **Location fetch**  
   - On signup, app fetches user‚Äôs location using Geolocation API and reverse geocodes it.


## Behind the Scenes (Short Overview)

- **React Frontend** handles UI, routing, and state (cart, forms).
- **Express Backend** manages authentication, food data, and orders.
- **MongoDB Atlas** stores all users, food items, and orders.
- **Render.com** (or similar) is used for deploying backend API.
- **GitHub Pages** hosts the frontend.
